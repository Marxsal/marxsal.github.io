## Quinoid Pre-releases

Quinoid is an attempt to use TiddlyWiki on Android.

These are definitely alpha/beta, experiemntal releases and should not be used in a production environment.

For Android 4.4 thru 7 (?)

You will need a 3rd party file explorer such as _ES-File_ or _Amaze_. For some reason the code doesn't play nicely with internal file explorers. You will probably also need your files to be on an external (separate) SD card in this version. Possibly some future edition will make use of internal storage.

Download and place somewhere on your device. Right click and install. Open the app.

Add TiddlyWiki files to the list with the Find button. You will need to pick a file explorer to use.

Once you have your list, click on list to launch viewer. It takes a bit of time to load (possibly because it is loading as many TWs as you listed).

But once you have them loaded, swipe left/right to change. This addresses a problem with AndTidWiki which made it difficult to run more than one TW at a time. Use back arrow to return to TW listing. Long press to remove entries.

Use at your own risk.
