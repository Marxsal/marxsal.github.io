## Quinoid Pre-Releezes

__(The bad spelling is deliberate for obscure, technical reasons)__

Quinoid is an attempt to use TiddlyWiki on Android. It should be able to save on your internal file system. Interested to know how it's working on external file systems.

These are definitely alpha/beta, experimental and should not be used in a production environment. 

For Android 4.4 thru 8 (?)

Download and place somewhere on your device. Click and choose to install. Open the app.

Add TiddlyWiki files to the list with the Find button. This version introduces an experimental file picker. Tentatively, you can pick more than one file at a time.

Once you have your list, click on list to launch viewer. It takes a bit of time to load (possibly because it is loading as many TWs as you listed).

But once you have them loaded, swipe left/right to change. This addresses a problem with AndTidWiki which made it difficult to run more than one TW at a time. Use back arrow to return to TW listing. Long press to remove entries.

If you are loading a large TW file, then Android may reclaim memory when you swipe, losing your current settings. So be sure to save before swiping if you've done something important.
Use at your own risk.
